# CDP-SGD
Welcome to the Composite Differentially Private SGD algorithm!

This is the code for Composite Differentially Private SGD algorithm.

Details on how to start training and selecting model parameters can be found in the file: Configure.txt.

Additionally, due to the large size of the datasets, only the compressed file for the MNIST dataset has been uploaded here. Users will need to decompress this file in the 'data' folder before it can be used. For other datasets, such as FMNIST, CIFAR-10, and IMDB, the users must download them independently and place them in the 'data' folder before they can be used for training.
